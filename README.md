# PythonArchive
A collection of amateur Python3 code I've worked over in my free time in high school over the past 3 years.
Note: This is not all of the code I've written as I failed to preserve much of it accurately at the time + alot of my code was just praciticing new concepts which I deleted later.
Some of the code has been optimized recently as I found it to be inefficient in pre-publish review.
